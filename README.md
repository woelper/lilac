## What's this?

A thing like Bootstrap or Material Design Lite (MDL). It styles your HTML document. It works on mobile devices, too.
- Why?

There are several reasons you might want to try this:
- Configurable: No LESS/SASS. Instead CSS variables you can configure in one place.
- Color schemes/skins built in: By default, harmonic secondary and accent colors are applied to --main-color, so everything looks good even if you just configure your main color.
- No js.
- Less HTML to write. Write HTML like you did in '95, then slap this over.

Why you may NOT want to try this:
- By now I had the silly idea to override the style of base HTML elements. Maybe you don't want that.
- It's WIP.
